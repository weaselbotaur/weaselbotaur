Hi, I’m  B Keen, currently worrying about the hardware/software interface from a security perspective at Microsoft Azure.

I've got a conviction that many
of the layers between transistor and application programmers' API are two or three decades out of date, ill suited to the characteristics of both modern
hardware and modern programming.  I think there are some generic simplifying improvements possible, and furthermore that CMOS is about finished with no
replacement available and the work of the next couple decades is recovering the ability to write truly high performance programs in a generic way.
If the purpose of computing is insight, not numbers (Hamming), then the job of a computer architect is to find a useful and fundamentally truthful
abstraction to the physical device the application programmer wishes to control.
