- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @weaselbotaur but what appears on the government issued photo id is Benjamin Keen.
  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the hardware/software interface, formally from the position of security.

What's really printed into my ROM is a conviction that many
of the layers between transistor and application programmers' API are two or three decades out of date, ill suited to the characteristics of both modern
hardware and modern programming.  I think there are some generic simplifying improvements possible, and furthermore that CMOS is about finished with no
replacement available and the work of the next couple decades is recovering the ability to write truly high performance programs in a generic way.
If the purpose of computing is insight, not numbers (Hamming), then the job of a computer architect is to find a useful and fundamentally truthful
abstraction to the physical device the application programmer wishes to control.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning which end is up in Microsoft and Microsoft Azure.
  
- ðŸ“« Best option on how to reach me is benjaminkeen@microsoft.com.
